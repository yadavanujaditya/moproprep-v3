What should be the most likely diagnosis if the biochemical analysis showed elevated triglyceride levels?,Thoracic Duct Injury,Esophageal Rupture,Post Cardiac Injury Syndrome,Acute Pancreatitis,A,"### 1. DIRECT ANSWER & CORE EXPLANATION 
Option A is correct. The aspiration of 'milky fluid' (chyle) from the pleural space is diagnostic of a Chylothorax[cite: 467]. In a trauma setting, this is most commonly due to **Thoracic Duct Injury**[cite: 467, 473]. The hallmark biochemical finding is a triglyceride level > 110 mg/dL [cite: 469].

### 2. BREAKDOWN OF OPTIONS 
- ✅ **A (Thoracic Duct Injury):** The thoracic duct carries chyle (rich in chylomicrons/triglycerides); its rupture leaks this milky fluid into the chest [cite: 473].
- ❌ **B (Esophageal Rupture):** Would typically show high salivary amylase and low pH in the pleural fluid, not high triglycerides [cite: 470].
- ❌ **D (Acute Pancreatitis):** Can cause a pleural effusion, but it would be rich in pancreatic amylase[cite: 471].

77,2024,Which of the following causes rib-notching on the chest radiography?,Bidirectional Glem shunt,Modified Blalock-Taussing shunt,IVC occlusion,Coarctation of aorta,D,"### 1. DIRECT ANSWER & CORE EXPLANATION 
Option D is correct[cite: 648]. Rib notching (specifically inferior rib notching) is a classic radiological sign of **Coarctation of the Aorta**[cite: 504]. It occurs due to pressure erosion by dilated, tortuous intercostal arteries which act as collaterals to bypass the aortic narrowing [cite: 500].

### 2. BREAKDOWN OF OPTIONS 
- ✅ **D (Coarctation of aorta):** Characterized by '3-sign' on X-ray and rib notching of the 3rd to 8th ribs [cite: 504].
- ❌ **B (Modified Blalock-Taussig shunt):** A palliative surgical shunt for cyanotic heart disease; it may cause rib notching on the *superior* aspect if subclavian flow is affected, but coarctation is the classic answer [cite: 501].

Option C is correct[cite: 648]. Preterm infants generally develop the coordination of sucking, swallowing, and breathing—necessary for safe oral feeding—at around **32 to 34 weeks** of gestational age[cite: 510]. Before this age, they usually require orogastric or nasogastric tube feeding [cite: 506].

### 2. BREAKDOWN OF OPTIONS 
- ✅ **C (After 32 weeks):** The developmental milestone for suck-swallow coordination [cite: 510].
- ❌ **A, B, D:** At these earlier ages, the risk of aspiration is high because the neuromuscular coordination is immature [cite: 508, 509, 511].
