The primary pathophysiology of Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) involves the generation of **critical sub-atmospheric (negative) pressure** during inspiration[cite: 461, 462].

      "explanation": "### 1. DIRECT ANSWER & CORE EXPLANATION\\nOption b is correct. While both are used, **Serum Lipase** is more sensitive and specific than amylase for acute pancreatitis. It also stays elevated for a longer period (7–14 days).\\n\\n### 2. BREAKDOWN OF OPTIONS\\n- ✅ **b (Lipase):** Preferred diagnostic marker due to higher specificity.\\n- ❌ **a (Amylase):** Elevated in many other conditions (e.g., parotitis, perforated ulcer) and returns to normal quickly (3–5 days).\\n\\n### 3. MEMORY AID (MNEMONIC)\\n**'L for Lipase = L for Long-lasting and Loyal (specific)'**.\\n\\n### 4. FUTURE QUESTIONS & CONNECTIONS\\n- **Potential Question:** 'What is the diagnostic threshold for Amylase/Lipase in pancreatitis?' (At least 3 times the upper limit of normal).\\n- **Key Connection:** High-yield for **Surgery** and **Medicine**.",
